# Brutus üó°Ô∏è 

Brutus is a **Botnet**, written entirely in **Python** targeting **Windows machines**.

It gives the attacker control over the victim's machine and enables him to:

- **Stream images over the victim's webcam**
- **Stream audio over the victim's microphone**
- **Take screenshots of the victim's desktop**
- **Run batch commands & receive the output of those**
- **Automatically create a backdoor after execution**
- **Get the victim's location through the IPv4 address**

The **Command Line Interface / CLI** of Brutus had to be developed **manually**   
because in Python the **"input()" - function** disables the script from  
**printing output** to the **regular CLI** when awaiting user input.

The **PYQT Framework** is used for the creation of the GUI.   
**Asynchronous TCP-Socket connections** are used to transfer data.  

It's efficient and enables the script to receive output from infected devices  
and send input/commands to those devices **at the same time**.

Connected users are given an individual **ID-Number**  
over which they can be adressed in the CLI.
